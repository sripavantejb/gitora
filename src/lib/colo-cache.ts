// The page cache on Cloudflare: a copy of each cached page in every
// Cloudflare location, and the wrappers that go with it
// (open-next.config.ts wires them in). Only the Cloudflare build uses this.
//
// Cached pages live in R2, one bucket for the world, and whether one is
// still valid is a question for the tag cache (Durable Objects). Asked on
// every request, those two round trips are most of a cached page's response
// time, and from another continent each is several hundred milliseconds.
// So the cache has three levels:
//
// 1. Every location keeps its own copy of a page in the Cache API and
//    answers from it alone. A copy is trusted for RECHECK_MS; a hit on an
//    older one is still answered at once, and the copy is brought in line
//    after the response (replaced, or dropped if the page was revalidated).
// 2. A location without a copy sends the request on to the server Worker
//    marked "entry wanted" (ENTRY_WANTED): if the server has a current entry
//    it answers with that (gzipped) instead of rendering, and the location
//    keeps it and answers from it. One round trip to where the server runs,
//    next to R2 and the tag cache, instead of two long ones from the
//    visitor's side of the world; and a page nobody has cached costs no extra
//    trip, the server just renders it. The server answers from its own
//    location's copies, which hold every page the world has asked for.
// 3. The server reads R2 and asks the tag cache.
//
// Freshness: `revalidatePath` drops the copy where it runs and the copy
// where the server runs at once, so whoever changed a page gets it rendered
// on their next request (not the old page first); a copy in another location
// follows within RECHECK_MS + FRESH_WITHIN_MS plus one request. A copy is only
// ever made of an entry the tag cache calls current, so an invalidated page
// never comes back out of R2 into a location.
//
// OpenNext's own `withRegionalCache` reads R2 on every hit instead (its
// "lazy update") and still asks the tag cache each time.

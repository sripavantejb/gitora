// The Next.js server on Cloudflare Workers: Worker `gitdiagram-server`
// (wrangler.server.jsonc). It has no address of its own. The site's Worker
// (cloudflare/worker.ts) calls it over a service binding for every request
// its routing layer and page cache could not answer: page renders, RSC
// payloads, the API routes. Those arrive already routed, with the
// Vercel-style headers the Workers in front wrote. The edge Worker
// (cloudflare/edge.ts) calls it directly for a page it has no copy of.
//
// It runs in one place, next to Redis and R2 (`placement` in
// wrangler.server.jsonc), so it is also where a Cloudflare location without
// a copy of a cached page gets one (CACHE_ENTRY_PATH, src/lib/colo-cache.ts).
